# Issue Implementation Workflow

## Label Management

**IMPORTANT:** Update the issue label when entering each phase. Remove the previous phase label and add the new one.

## Getting Started

1. **Branch:** `issues/[number]/[title-kebab-case]`
2. **Draft PR:** Create a draft PR with body `Closes #[number]`
3. **Install:** Run `scripts/install_tools.ps1`

## Phase 1: User Experience Design

**On entry:** Update labels from `Conceptual-Definition` → `UX-Design`

Post as issue comment:

```markdown
## User Experience Design
**User Flow:** [Description of user interaction flow]
**UI Components:** [New or modified UI elements]
**Mockups/Wireframes:** [Links or descriptions]
**Accessibility:** [A11y considerations]
```

Required for: User-facing features, UI changes, new workflows.
Skip for: Backend-only changes, infrastructure, refactoring (proceed to Phase 2).

## Phase 2: Technical Design

**On entry:** Update labels from `UX-Design` → `Technical-Design`

Post as issue comment:

```markdown
## Technical Design
**Affected Components:** [Files to modify/create]
**Implementation Steps:**
1. [Step with file and change]
**Dependencies:** [New packages or "None"]
**Tests:** [Describe unit, integration, Angular tests needed]
```

## Phase 3: Acceptance Test Design

**On entry:** Update labels from `Technical-Design` → `Test-Design`

Post as issue comment:

```markdown
## Acceptance Test Design
**Acceptance Tests:** [E2E workflow tests] or None required - [rationale]
```

Required for: User-facing features, critical workflows, deployed behavior changes.
Skip for: Backend-only, UI-only, docs, refactoring (proceed to Phase 4).

## Phase 4: Development

**On entry:** Update labels from `Test-Design` → `Development`

1. Implement changes following `architecture-rules.mdc`
2. Add tests per `automated-testing-rules.mdc`
3. Run `scripts/build_and_test.ps1` until passing
4. Commit and push

**Gate:** `build_and_test.ps1` must pass before proceeding.

## Phase 5: Functional Validation

**On entry:** Update labels from `Development` → `Functional-Validation`

1. Run `scripts/acceptance_tests.ps1` until passing

**Gate:** Both test scripts must pass before proceeding.

## Phase 6: Review Handoff

**On entry:** Update labels from `Functional-Validation` → `Ready-For-Review`

1. Verify all tests passed (unit, integration, Angular, acceptance)
2. Move PR from draft to ready for review

**Gate:** All tests must pass before marking ready.
