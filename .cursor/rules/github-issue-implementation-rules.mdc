# Issue Implementation Workflow

When assigned to work on a GitHub issue, follow this phased workflow. Each phase requires updating labels and documenting progress via issue comments.

## Phase 1: Technical Design

1. Read and understand the issue requirements
2. Update issue labels: remove all existing labels, add `Technical-Design`
3. Explore the codebase to understand relevant components and dependencies
4. Formulate an implementation plan focused on architecture and code changes (exclude test considerations)
5. Add the Technical Design as a comment to the issue using this format:

```markdown
## Technical Design

**Affected Components:** [List of files/modules to modify or create]

**Implementation Steps:**
1. [Step with specific file and change description]
2. [Continue for all steps...]

**Dependencies:** [Any new packages or infrastructure required]
```

## Phase 2: Test Design

1. Update issue labels: remove all existing labels, add `Test-Design`
2. Review the issue requirements, Technical Design comment, and `@.cursor/rules/automated-testing.mdc`
3. Formulate a test plan covering required unit, integration, and acceptance tests
4. Add the Test Design as a comment to the issue using this format:

```markdown
## Test Design

**Unit Tests:**
- [Test description and category from automated-testing.mdc]

**Integration Tests:**
- [Test description covering component interactions]

**Acceptance Tests:**
- [Test description covering user workflows]
```

## Phase 3: Development

1. Update issue labels: remove all existing labels, add `Development`
2. Implement the Technical Design changes
3. Implement the Test Design tests
4. Run `scripts/build_and_test.ps1` to verify all changes
5. If the script fails to execute for any reason (missing dependencies, Docker issues, environment problems, etc.), diagnose and fix the issue, then re-run the script
6. If any tests fail, fix the code or tests until all tests pass
7. Repeat steps 4-6 until the script completes successfully with all tests passing
8. **Prerequisite for PR:** All tests must execute and pass — do not open a pull request until `scripts/build_and_test.ps1` completes with zero failures
9. Commit changes and open a pull request referencing the issue

## Phase 4: Validation Handoff

1. Update issue labels: remove all existing labels, add `Functional-Validation`

**Note:** Do not close the issue. The `Functional-Validation` label signals that manual review and testing are required before closure.
