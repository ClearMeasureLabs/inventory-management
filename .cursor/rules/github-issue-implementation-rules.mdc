# Issue Implementation Workflow

## Label Management

**IMPORTANT:** The label indicates the **current phase**. When completing a phase, remove the current label and add the **next phase's label** to signal the issue is ready for that phase.

## Getting Started

1. **Branch:** `issues/[number]/[title-kebab-case]`
2. **Draft PR:** Create a draft PR with body `Closes #[number]`
3. **Install:** Run `scripts/install_tools.ps1`

## Phase 1: User Experience Design

**Trigger:** Issue has `UX-Design` label

Post as issue comment:

```markdown
## User Experience Design
**User Flow:** [Description of user interaction flow]
**UI Components:** [New or modified UI elements]
**Mockups/Wireframes:** [Links or descriptions]
**Accessibility:** [A11y considerations]
```

**On completion:** Update labels `UX-Design` → `Technical-Design`

Required for: User-facing features, UI changes, new workflows.
Skip for: Backend-only changes, infrastructure, refactoring (set `Technical-Design` label directly).

## Phase 2: Technical Design

**Trigger:** Issue has `Technical-Design` label

Post as issue comment:

```markdown
## Technical Design
**Affected Components:** [Files to modify/create]
**Implementation Steps:**
1. [Step with file and change]
**Dependencies:** [New packages or "None"]
**Tests:** [Describe unit, integration, Angular tests needed]
```

**On completion:** Update labels `Technical-Design` → `Test-Design` (or `Development` if skipping test design)

## Phase 3: Acceptance Test Design

**Trigger:** Issue has `Test-Design` label

Post as issue comment:

```markdown
## Acceptance Test Design
**Acceptance Tests:** [E2E workflow tests] or None required - [rationale]
```

**On completion:** Update labels `Test-Design` → `Development`

Required for: User-facing features, critical workflows, deployed behavior changes.
Skip for: Backend-only, UI-only, docs, refactoring (set `Development` label directly).

## Phase 4: Development

**Trigger:** Issue has `Development` label

1. Implement changes following `architecture-rules.mdc`
2. Add tests per `automated-testing-rules.mdc`
3. Run `scripts/build_and_test.ps1` until passing
4. Commit and push

**On completion:** Update labels `Development` → `Functional-Validation`

**Gate:** `build_and_test.ps1` must pass before proceeding.

## Phase 5: Functional Validation

**Trigger:** Issue has `Functional-Validation` label

1. Run `scripts/acceptance_tests.ps1` until passing
2. Verify all tests passed (unit, integration, Angular, acceptance)
3. Move PR from draft to ready for review

**On completion:** Update labels `Functional-Validation` → `Ready-For-Review`

**Gate:** Both `build_and_test.ps1` and `acceptance_tests.ps1` must pass before marking ready.
