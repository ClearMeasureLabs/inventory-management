# Issue Implementation Workflow

Update issue labels at each phase transition.

## Getting Started

1. **Branch:** `issues/[number]/[title-kebab-case]`
2. **Draft PR:** `gh pr create --draft --title "[Title]" --body "Closes #[number]"`
3. **Install:** `scripts/install_tools.ps1`

## Phase 1: Technical Design

**Label:** `Technical-Design`

Post as issue comment:

```markdown
## Technical Design
**Affected Components:** [Files to modify/create]
**Implementation Steps:**
1. [Step with file and change]
**Dependencies:** [New packages or "None"]
**Tests:** [Describe unit, integration, Angular tests needed]
```

## Phase 2: Acceptance Test Design

**Label:** `Test-Design`

Post as issue comment:

```markdown
## Acceptance Test Design
**Acceptance Tests:** [E2E workflow tests] or None required - [rationale]
```

Required for: User-facing features, critical workflows, deployed behavior changes.
Not required for: Backend-only, UI-only, docs, refactoring.

## Phase 3: Development

**Label:** `Development`

1. Implement changes following `architecture-rules.mdc`
2. Add tests per `automated-testing-rules.mdc`
3. Run `scripts/build_and_test.ps1` until passing
4. Commit and push

**Gate:** `build_and_test.ps1` must pass.

## Phase 4: Functional Validation

**Label:** `Functional-Validation`

1. Run `scripts/acceptance_tests.ps1` until passing
2. Add label to PR: `gh pr edit --add-label "Functional-Validation"`

**Gate:** Both test scripts must pass.

## Phase 5: Review Handoff

1. Verify all tests passed (unit, integration, Angular, acceptance)
2. Mark ready: `gh pr ready`

**Gate:** All tests must pass before marking ready.
