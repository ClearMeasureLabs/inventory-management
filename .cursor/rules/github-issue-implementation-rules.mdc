# Issue Implementation Workflow

Follow this phased workflow when implementing GitHub issues. Update labels at each phase transition.

## Getting Started

1. **Create branch:** `issues/[issue-number]/[issue-title-in-kebab-case]`
   - Example: Issue #42 "Add User Authentication" → `issues/42/add-user-authentication`

2. **Open draft PR immediately:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin [branch-name]
   gh pr create --draft --title "[Issue Title]" --body "Closes #[issue-number]"
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:** `scripts/install_tools.ps1`

## Phase 1: Technical Design

**Label:** `Technical-Design`

Explore the codebase and document the implementation plan as an issue comment:

```markdown
## Technical Design

**Affected Components:** [Files/modules to modify or create]

**Implementation Steps:**
1. [Step with specific file and change description]
2. [Continue for all steps...]

**Dependencies:** [New packages or infrastructure, or "None"]

**Unit Tests:** [Test descriptions, or "None required" with rationale]

**Integration Tests:** [Test descriptions, or "None required" with rationale]

**Angular Tests:** [Test descriptions, or "None required" with rationale]
```

## Phase 2: Acceptance Test Design

**Label:** `Test-Design`

Determine if end-to-end acceptance tests are needed and document as an issue comment:

```markdown
## Acceptance Test Design

**Acceptance Tests:**
- [Test description covering end-to-end user workflow]

OR

**Acceptance Tests:** None required - [rationale]
```

**Required when:** New user-facing features, critical workflows, or changes affecting deployed behavior.

**Not required when:** Backend-only changes, UI-only changes, documentation, or refactoring.

## Phase 3: Development

**Label:** `Development`

1. Implement the Technical Design changes and tests
2. Run `scripts/build_and_test.ps1` (unit, integration, Angular tests)
3. Fix any failures and repeat until all tests pass
4. Commit and push changes

**Gate:** Do not proceed until `build_and_test.ps1` passes.

## Phase 4: Functional Validation

**Label:** `Functional-Validation` (issue and PR)

1. Run `scripts/acceptance_tests.ps1` (deploys app and runs Playwright tests)
2. Fix any failures and repeat until all tests pass
3. Add label to PR: `gh pr edit --add-label "Functional-Validation"`

**Gate:** Both `build_and_test.ps1` and `acceptance_tests.ps1` must pass.

## Phase 5: Review Handoff

1. Verify all 4 test suites passed:
   - Unit tests ✓
   - Integration tests ✓
   - Angular tests ✓
   - Acceptance tests ✓

2. Mark PR ready for review: `gh pr ready`

**Gate:** PR cannot be marked ready until ALL tests pass.
