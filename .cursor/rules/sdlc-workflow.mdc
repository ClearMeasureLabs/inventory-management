# SDLC Workflow Requirement

**ALWAYS** follow the staged workflow in `.agents/` when making code changes.

## Required Workflow

Before any code modification:

1. **Read the relevant instruction file** from `.agents/` for your current phase
2. **Follow the process defined** in that instruction file
3. **Complete the phase outputs** before moving to the next phase

## SDLC Phases

| Phase | When to Use | Instructions File |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1. Issue Creation | New feature/bug request | `.agents/1-issue-creation-instructions.md` |
| 2. UX Design | User-facing changes | `.agents/2-ux-design-instructions.md` |
| 3. Technical Design | Architecture decisions | `.agents/3-technical-design-instructions.md` |
| 4. Test Design | Define test strategy | `.agents/4-test-design-instructions.md` |
| 5. Development | Implementation | `.agents/5-development-instructions.md` |
| 6. Code Review | Review changes | `.agents/6-code-review-instructions.md` |
| 7. Implement Changes | Address review feedback | `.agents/7-implement-changes-instructions.md` |
| 8. Functional Validation | Final verification | `.agents/8-functional-validation-instructions.md` |

## Rules

- **NEVER** skip directly to coding without an associated GitHub issue
- **ALWAYS** read the instruction file for your current phase before starting work
- **Use judgment** on which phases apply—not all changes require all phases
- Backend-only changes can skip UX Design (phase 2)
- Simple fixes may skip Technical Design (phase 3)
