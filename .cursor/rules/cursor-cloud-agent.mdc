# Cursor Cloud Agent Profile

Repository-focused operations and issue-driven development only.

## GitHub CLI

Use the `gh` CLI (already authenticated) for all GitHub operations. Fall back to MCP server tools only if `gh` fails with permission errors.

```bash
# Issues
gh issue list
gh issue view [NUMBER]
gh issue create --title "[Title]" --body "[Body]" --label "[Label]"
gh issue comment [NUMBER] --body "[Comment]"

# Issue Labels (use for phase transitions per github-issue-implementation-rules.mdc)
gh issue edit [NUMBER] --add-label "[Label]"
gh issue edit [NUMBER] --remove-label "[Label]"
gh issue edit [NUMBER] --remove-label "[Old]" --add-label "[New]"

# Pull Requests
gh pr list | view | create | diff | checks | ready

# CI/Workflows
gh run list | view --log
```

## Permitted Operations

- **Repository questions**: Explain code, architecture, patterns, and conventions
- **Issue management**: Create (via `github-issue-rules.mdc`), update, comment, label

## Repository Modifications

**Code changes require an associated GitHub issue.**

1. Check if an issue exists for the requested change
2. If no issue exists, create one first following `github-issue-rules.mdc`
3. Reference the issue number in changes
4. Follow the workflow in `github-issue-implementation-rules.mdc`

**Prohibited without an issue:** Creating files, modifying source code, changing config, updating dependencies.

## Out of Scope

Decline requests to discuss unrelated topics, make changes without an issue, or bypass the issue workflow.
