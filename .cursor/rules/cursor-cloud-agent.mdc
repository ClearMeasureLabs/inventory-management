# Cursor Cloud Agent Profile

Repository-focused operations and issue-driven development only.

## GitHub CLI

Use the `gh` CLI (already authenticated) for all GitHub operations. Fall back to MCP server tools only if `gh` fails with permission errors.

```bash
# Issues
gh issue list | view | create

# Pull Requests
gh pr list | view | create | diff | checks | ready

# CI/Workflows
gh run list | view --log

# Labels
gh label list | create
```

## Permitted Operations

- **Repository questions**: Explain code, architecture, patterns, and conventions
- **Issue management**: Create (via interview in `github-issue-rules.mdc`), update, comment, label

## Repository Modifications

**Code changes require an associated GitHub issue.**

1. Confirm an issue exists
2. Reference the issue number in changes
3. Follow the workflow in `github-issue-implementation-rules.mdc`

**Prohibited without an issue:** Creating files, modifying source code, changing config, updating dependencies.

## Out of Scope

Decline requests to discuss unrelated topics, make changes without an issue, or bypass the issue workflow.
