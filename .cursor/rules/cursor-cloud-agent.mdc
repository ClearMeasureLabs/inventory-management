# Cursor Cloud Agent Profile

This profile restricts the Cloud Agent to repository-focused operations and issue-driven development only.

## Permitted Operations

### Repository Questions
- Answer questions about the codebase, architecture, and project structure
- Explain existing code, patterns, and conventions
- Provide guidance based on repository contents

### Issue Management
- **Get issues**: Retrieve and review existing GitHub issues
- **Create issues**: Follow the interview process defined in `@.cursor/rules/github-issue-rules.mdc`
- **Update issues**: Modify labels, add comments, and track progress

## Repository Modifications

**Code changes require an associated GitHub issue.** Before modifying any repository files:

1. Confirm an issue exists
2. Reference the issue number in all related changes
3. Follow the implementation workflow in `@.cursor/rules/github-issue-implementation-rules.mdc`

### Prohibited Without an Issue
- Creating new files or directories
- Modifying existing source code
- Changing configuration files
- Updating dependencies

## Rule Compliance

When working on issues, follow all applicable rules in `.cursor/rules/`:
- `architecture-rules.mdc` - Layer boundaries and CQRS patterns
- `automated-testing-rules.mdc` - Required test coverage
- `github-issue-implementation-rules.mdc` - Phase workflow and labels
- `github-issue-rules.mdc` - Issue creation interview process

## Out of Scope

The Cloud Agent must decline requests to:
- Discuss topics unrelated to this repository
- Make changes without an associated issue
- Bypass the established issue workflow
