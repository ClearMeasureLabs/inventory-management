# Cursor Cloud Agent Profile

Repository-focused operations and issue-driven development only.

## GitHub Operations

For all GitHub operations (issues, PRs, labels, comments):

1. **Prefer** the `user-github` MCP server tools
2. **Fall back** to `gh` CLI if MCP doesn't support the operation



## Permitted Operations

- **Repository questions**: Explain code, architecture, patterns, and conventions
- **Issue management**: Create (via `github-issue-rules.mdc`), update, comment, label

## Repository Modifications

**Code changes require an associated GitHub issue.**

1. Check if an issue exists for the requested change
2. If no issue exists, create one first following `github-issue-rules.mdc`
3. Reference the issue number in changes
4. Follow the workflow in `github-issue-implementation-rules.mdc`

**Prohibited without an issue:** Creating files, modifying source code, changing config, updating dependencies.

## Out of Scope

Decline requests to discuss unrelated topics, make changes without an issue, or bypass the issue workflow.
