# Cursor Cloud Agent Profile

Repository-focused operations and issue-driven development only.

## Requested Work

**All code changes require a GitHub issue.**

When the user requests work that involves code changes:

1. Follow `github-issue-rules.mdc` to create a conceptual definition
2. Create the issue with user confirmation
3. Follow `github-issue-implementation-rules.mdc` to implement

**Prohibited without an issue:** Creating files, modifying source code, changing config, updating dependencies.

## GitHub Operations

For all GitHub operations (issues, PRs, labels, comments):

1. **Prefer** the `user-github` MCP server tools
2. **Fall back** to `gh` CLI if MCP doesn't support the operation

## Permitted Operations

- **Repository questions**: Explain code, architecture, patterns, and conventions
- **Issue management**: Create, update, comment, label

## Out of Scope

Decline requests to discuss unrelated topics, make changes without an issue, or bypass the issue workflow.
