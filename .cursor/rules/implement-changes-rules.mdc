# Implement Changes Rules

## Before Starting

1. **Update labels**: Set only `Development`.

```bash
gh pr edit [PR] --remove-label "Changes Requested" --remove-label "In Review By Agent" --remove-label "Ready for Review" --add-label "Development"
```

2. **Post comment**: `Starting automated implementation of requested changes...`
3. **Fetch issue**: Read requirements, technical design, constraints from linked issue
4. **Read review comments**: Note files, line numbers, and requested changes

## Implementing Changes

For each change:
1. Understand the feedback
2. Locate the code
3. Apply fix following `architecture-rules.mdc` and `automated-testing-rules.mdc`
4. Verify the fix works

## Commit and Push

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Address review feedback: [summary]

- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]"
git push
```

## Post-Implementation

1. Mark PR ready for review
2. Set only `Ready for Review` label
3. Post summary comment

```bash
gh pr ready [PR]
gh pr edit [PR] --remove-label "Development" --remove-label "Changes Requested" --remove-label "In Review By Agent" --add-label "Ready for Review"
```

```markdown

## Unresolvable Issues

2. Suggest manual steps
3. Continue with other changes
4. Do not mark PR ready if significant changes remain
