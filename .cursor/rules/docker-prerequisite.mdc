# Docker Prerequisite Check

Before making any code changes, verify Docker is available.

## Required Check

Run this command before starting development work:

```powershell
docker info
```

**If successful:** Docker is running - proceed with changes.

**If failed:** Docker is not running or not installed.

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `error during connect` | Start Docker Desktop |
| `command not found` | Install Docker Desktop |
| `permission denied` | Run terminal as administrator |

## When to Check

- At the start of any issue implementation
- Before running `build_and_test.ps1`
- Before running `acceptance_tests.ps1`
- Before any Docker Compose operations
