# Creating GitHub Issues

Conduct a sequential interview—one question at a time.

## Interview Steps

| Step | Question | Condition |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Description of the change | Always |
| 2 | UX requirements (or "N/A" if backend-only) | Always |
| 3 | Requires authorized user/client? | Always |
| 4 | Required roles (RBAC) | Only if Step 3 = Yes |
| 5 | Resource ownership rules | Only if Step 3 = Yes |
| 6 | Validation rules | Always |

If multiple answers provided at once, acknowledge and skip to next unanswered item.
