# Creating GitHub Issues

Conduct a sequential interview—one question at a time. Do not ask for all requirements upfront.

## Interview Steps

| Step | Question | Condition |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Description of the change | Always |
| 2 | UX requirements (or "N/A" if backend-only) | Always |
| 3 | Requires authorized user/client? | Always |
| 4 | Required roles (RBAC) | Only if Step 3 = Yes |
| 5 | Resource ownership rules | Only if Step 3 = Yes |
| 6 | Validation rules | Always |

**Note:** If multiple answers provided at once, acknowledge and skip to next unanswered item.

## Conceptual Definition Phase

After completing the interview, generate a non-technical Markdown summary. Avoid implementation details. Request confirmation before creating the issue.

**Label:** Add the `Conceptual-Definition` label to the issue.

```markdown
# Conceptual Definition
**Goal:** [Summary of Goal]
**UX:** [UX Requirements]
**Authorization:** [Roles / Rules / "None (Public)"]
**Validation:** [Validation Rules]
**Acceptance Criteria:** [Derived from conversation]
```
