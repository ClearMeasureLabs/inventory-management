# Creating GitHub Issues

Generate the conceptual definition directly from the user's prompt. Only ask follow-up questions for missing critical details.

## Required Information

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Goal | What the change accomplishes |
| UX | User experience requirements (or "N/A" if backend-only) |
| Authorization | Required roles/ownership rules (or "None (Public)") |
| Validation | Input validation and business rules |
| Acceptance Criteria | Conditions for completion |

## Process

1. **Analyze the prompt** — Extract as much information as possible from the user's initial request
2. **Draft the definition** — Generate a complete conceptual definition using available details
3. **Identify gaps** — If critical information is missing, ask targeted follow-up questions
4. **Confirm and create** — Request user confirmation, then create the issue

## Conceptual Definition Template

```markdown
# Conceptual Definition
**Goal:** [Summary]
**UX:** [Requirements or N/A]
**Authorization:** [Roles / Rules / "None (Public)"]
**Validation:** [Rules]
**Acceptance Criteria:** [Derived from request]
```

## Creating the Issue

After user confirms, create the issue with the `Conceptual-Definition` label:

```bash
gh issue create --title "[Title]" --body "[Conceptual Definition]" --label "Conceptual-Definition"
```

This label is the starting point for the implementation workflow in `github-issue-implementation-rules.mdc`.
